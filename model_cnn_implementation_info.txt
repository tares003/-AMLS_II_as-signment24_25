   - Class distribution
   - Sample images from each class

2. **Data augmentation visualization**:
   - Side-by-side comparison of original and augmented images
   - Multiple augmentation examples

3. **Model activation visualization**:
   - Layer-specific feature map visualization
   - Multiple layer activation visualization

   - Loss curves (training and validation)

## Prediction & Submission
- Test images are loaded, resized, and passed through the model
- Argmax of probabilities determines the predicted class
- Results are saved to submission.csv for competition submission

## Technical Implementation
- **Framework**: TensorFlow/Keras
- **Primary libraries**:
  - TensorFlow 2.x
  - Keras (via tf.keras)
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization
  - PIL/OpenCV for image processing

## Potential Improvements

### Data Processing
1. **Test-time augmentation**: Average predictions over multiple augmented versions of test images
2. **Balanced sampling**: Address class imbalance with weighted sampling or class weights
3. **Progressive resizing**: Train initially on smaller images, then fine-tune on larger images
4. **More aggressive augmentation**: MixUp, CutMix, GridMask, or other advanced augmentation techniques

### Model Architecture
1. **Larger EfficientNet variants**: Try EfficientNetB3-B7 for potentially higher accuracy
2. **Ensemble models**: Combine predictions from multiple models trained with different architectures or configurations
3. **Custom layers**: Add attention mechanisms or other specialized layers
4. **Feature extraction**: Extract features from multiple EfficientNet layers before classification

### Training Strategy
1. **Multi-stage training**:
   - First stage: Train only the top layers
   - Second stage: Fine-tune more layers with lower learning rate
   - Third stage: Fine-tune all layers with very low learning rate

2. **Learning rate scheduling**:
   - One-cycle learning rate policy
   - Cosine annealing with warm restarts

3. **Optimization techniques**:
   - Mixed-precision training for speed
   - Gradient accumulation to simulate larger batch sizes
   - Different optimizers (RAdam, Lookahead, etc.)

4. **Loss functions**:
   - Label smoothing
   - Focal loss for addressing class imbalance

### Validation Strategies
1. **K-fold cross-validation**: Train K models on different data splits and ensemble results
2. **Stratified sampling**: Ensure validation set has the same class distribution as training set
3. **Train-validation-test split**: Include a hold-out test set for final evaluation

### Interpretability
1. **GradCAM visualization**: Show which parts of images are most important for classification
2. **SHAP values**: Explain model predictions with Shapley additive explanations
3. **Confusion matrix analysis**: Identify which classes are most often confused

### Deployment Enhancements
1. **Model quantization**: Reduce model size and increase inference speed
2. **Model pruning**: Remove redundant connections to make model more efficient
3. **ONNX conversion**: Convert model to ONNX format for deployment in different environments
4. **TensorRT optimization**: Optimize for NVIDIA GPUs if deploying on compatible hardware

### Code Improvements
1. **Configuration file**: Move all hyperparameters to a config file for easier experimentation
2. **Experiment tracking**: Integrate with MLflow, Weights & Biases, or TensorBoard for tracking experiments
3. **Checkpointing**: More robust checkpointing and model resumption capability
4. **Multi-GPU training**: Distribute training across multiple GPUs for faster convergence
